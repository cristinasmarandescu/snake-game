# snake-game
First project in which I learned how to use classes.
For this game, I created the following classes:
  - Snake class - in order to create, extend, move and control the snake;
  - Food class - in order to create the food for the snake and randomize its' coordinates;
  - Scoreboard Class - in order to keep and update the current score and high score.
